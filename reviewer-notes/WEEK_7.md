This week, students complete the Store API assignment (04) from start to
finish.

Students will build out complex filtering and sorting options on a Rest API
endpoint:

> The idea is that one can search by any or all of these attributes: featured,
> name, price, rating, company. For the numeric fields price and rating, one
> can also specify greater than, less than, or equal to. One can also specify a
> sort order. Also one can specify a skip and a limit, to facilitate pagination
> through the result
