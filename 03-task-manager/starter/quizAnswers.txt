1. explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    - In an application, middleware is a method of validation. 
    This includes error handleing, authentication, and others alike.
    This allows an app to pass multiple methods/functions between code blocks 
    and run one after another.

2. What does CRUD stand for?
    - The CRUD abbreviation stands for Create, Read, Update, and Destroy. 
    This allows an API to create data provided froma  user, and then read the data.
    The data can be sent to a noSQL database like MongoDB where it can b stored.
    Then, the app allows the user to 'update' the data, in other words modify
    existing data to the database. Finally, the API allows a user to delete
    data from the database.
3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
    In order to keep api tokens secrete and other sensitive information, 
    storing the token as a varible allows programmers to use the variable 
    globally or locally. Instead of revealing it, it's accessed like a variable.


    2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
    To keep the .env file locally, and not pushed to github; including the
    file in the .gitignore directory allows it to be ingored when a developer
    pushes code to github
