1.Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
  Middleware can be used through its built in methods: app.use, app.get, app.post, app.delete.
  Also, middleware can be used for all routes: app.use(MIDDLEWARE) or to a specific route:
  app.get('/route',MIDDLEWARE,(req,res)...)

  That the format in which Middleware is applied is through the above formats. That is how one
  would use Middleware in an Express application. Furthermore, Middleware is an express 
  application that allows it to modify request and responses, therefore having control 
  over the application.

2.What does CRUD stand for? Create, Read, Update, Delete/Destroy

3.You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
  1.How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file? By writing a 
    require: require('dotenv').config() in order import the dotenv package which gives access to
    environmental variables from the .env file. Then, .config reads the contents of the file.
    Finally, they become accessible through the process.env
  2.How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
  You would add the .env to the .gitignore file.
