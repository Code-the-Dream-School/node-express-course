// The idea is that one can search by any or all of these attributes: featured, name, price, rating, company
// For the numeric fields price and rating, one can also specify greater than, less than, or equal to
// One can also specify a sort order 
// Also one can specify a skip and a limit, to facilitate pagination through the result

// That file has two methods, getAllProducts and getAllProductsStatic
// The getAllProductsStatic method is just for experimentation
